The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture is primarily associated with client-side applications, particularly in the context of user interfaces and frameworks like WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and Xamarin.


In MVVM, the Model represents the data and business logic of the application, the View represents the user interface, and the ViewModel acts as a mediator between the Model and the View. The ViewModel exposes data and commands that the View binds to, and it orchestrates the interactions between the Model and the View.


While MVVM is commonly used in client-side applications, it's important to note that the architecture itself is not limited to a specific platform or technology. It is a design pattern that can be implemented on various platforms, including desktop applications, mobile apps, and even web applications.


In web development, there is a similar architectural pattern called MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) that is commonly used with JavaScript frameworks like Angular and Knockout.js. In this context, the ViewModel represents the logic and state of the view, the Model represents the data, and the View represents the HTML user interface.


So, while MVVM is often associated with client-side development, it's important to consider the specific technology stack and platform you are working with to determine how it can be applied effectively.
